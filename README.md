# Driver Drowsiness Detection System üò¥üöó

A literature-based system developed as a final project for a Deep Learning course (CS 570). This project utilizes Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to monitor a driver's state and detect signs of drowsiness in real-time.

---

## üí° Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to enhance road safety by proactively identifying driver fatigue. The system works by analyzing video feeds to classify the state of the driver's eyes, determining if they are **open** or **closed**.

### Key Features
* **Real-time Eye State Classification:** Uses a pre-trained CNN model for high-speed eye state classification.
* **Region of Interest (ROI) Detection:** Employs **Haar Cascade Classifiers** to accurately detect the face and eyes, localizing the region of interest for analysis.
* **Drowsiness Alert:** Drowsiness is inferred and an alert is triggered based on the frequency and duration of closed eyes (i.e., counting the number of "eye flips" or blinks within a specific time frame).

## Outputs & Visuals
The system provides real-time detection, highlighting the driver and their eyes.

Example of System Output (Drowsiness Detected): Drowsiness is detected by counting the number of eye flips (blinks) in a given time period.
